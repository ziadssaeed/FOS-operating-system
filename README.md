# FOS - Faculty Operating System

FOS (Faculty Operating System) is a specialized educational project developed for the Operating Systems Course (CSW355) at Ain Shams University, Faculty of Computer and Information Science. The project is forked and refactored from MITâ€™s 6.828 Operating Systems Lab, originally created by Dr. Mahmoud Hossam and currently maintained by Dr. Ahmed Salah.

## Project Overview

FOS provides students with a hands-on experience in building core components of an operating system. It enables a deeper understanding of critical concepts such as memory management, scheduling, and synchronization by implementing them from scratch. The project is structured into three milestones:

### Milestone 1: Dynamic Memory Allocation and Command Prompt
- **Objective**: Lay the foundation of the operating system by building a dynamic memory allocator and integrating system calls.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - A basic command prompt interface
  - System call implementation for communication between user and kernel modes
  - Dynamic memory allocation strategies:
    - First Fit
    - Next Fit
    - Best Fit
  - Support for locks to handle concurrency

### Milestone 2: Memory Management and Fault Handling
- **Objective**: Develop essential memory management functions and handle basic page faults.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - Kernel Heap dynamic allocator for efficient memory utilization
  - Paging functions for memory management:
    - Allocate and free memory chunks
    - Translate between virtual and physical addresses
  - User Heap allocator for user-mode memory management
  - Shared memory mechanisms to facilitate inter-process communication

### Milestone 3: Advanced Fault Handling and CPU Scheduling
- **Objective**: Enhance memory fault handling, implement semaphores, and introduce a priority-based round-robin CPU scheduler.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - Nth Chance Clock page replacement algorithm
  - User-level semaphores for synchronization
  - Priority-based round-robin scheduler for efficient CPU management
  - Mechanisms to handle resource sharing and prevent deadlocks


Each milestone comes with a set of test cases to validate your implementation. Navigate to the test directory for the respective milestone and execute the provided scripts.
